# CPP-Modules
"C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia), The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming. This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. I decided to choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from my old friend C. Because this is a complex language.<br />
